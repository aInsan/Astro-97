    "One of the ways to study astronomical sources is by measuring the shape of their spectrum. A spectrum is a source's flux as a function of photon energy (or wavelength). In homework 1 we looked at the brightness of a blackbody as a function of wavelength, that was one of many functional forms that spectrum can take. A blackbody spectrum is one of several \"thermal\" spectrum. There are also many spectrum that are observed from \"non-thermal\" processes that can originate from things such as accelerating charged particles. A common \"non-thermal\" spectral form is a power-law. For a power-law spectrum, the differential photon flux is proportional to the photon energy raised to some power, known as the spectral index. A power-law spectrum is typically formulated as,  \n",
    "$$f_E\\left(E\\right)=C\\left(\\frac{E}{E_0}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where E is the photon energy, E0 is the pivot energy (a value kept constant), $\\alpha$ is the spectral index, and C is the normalization. C will have units of photons / cm2 / s / keV, the same units as the differential photon flux, as the rest is unitless (energy divided by energy cancels out). \n",

    "In this homework you will read in a FITS file that contains the detector response matrix (DRM) of a detector meant to detect gamma-ray bursts, called the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). If you want to learn more about Fermi GBM go hereLinks to an external site.. Much like in tutorial 10 you will find some basic properties of the DRM and calculate the effective area as a function of photon energy. You will then make a function that calculates the differential photon flux for a power-law spectrum. Finally, you will combine the information from your spectrum and the DRM to find the total number of counts and counts in each energy bin that Fermi GBM would detect from a power-law spectrum with a given spectral index and normalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding the expected number of counts from a theoretical spectrum is a necessary step in figuring out how long you need to observe a source for when requesting an observation. This process of finding the expected counts per energy bin for a given spectrum is also a step in the process of trying to determine spectral properties from observed spectral data. This is done by doing this over and over until you find the spectral properties that give the counts per energy bin that best match your observed counts in those energy bins. We will not go that far in this homework, but we will later on in the class. "
